# The Web3 WP WordPress Core Contributor NFT App

We are creating limited edition collectable “WordPress Core Contributor“ coins for each of the 41 major historical releases of WordPress all the way back to 0.7. We have compiled at great effort an exhaustive list of all these contributors to be able to reward them with this rare collectible.
 
Rather than mint and distribute these collectible coins in the real world via post or at events like WordCamps, we will be leveraging the power of Web3 to mint these as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)! These NFTs are distributed essentially as an “Airdrop”, as they can be minted free of charge only by WordPress Core Contributors. In fact these collectibles will actually be some of the first NFT WordPress swag following in the footsteps of our Wapuu NFT collection that launched Web3 WP.

This Nextjs React app allows you to browse WordPress contributors, mint your Core Contributor NFTs, and participate in the marketplace to buy and sell these collectable NFTs.

## Get started

Run `yarn` (install yarn globally if you havn't yet) on the root dir to install most requirements.

## The Frontend Website App

The website is built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS. It can be deployed to Next.js hosting like Vercel/Netlify, or as we did can be exported as static html and deployed on any host or CDN like Cloudflare Pages for unlimited scalability.

The config is in *next.config.js*.

**Commands:**

- Run the Next.js local development environment on http://localhost:3000: `yarn run dev`
